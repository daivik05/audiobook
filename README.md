# Audiobook

This Python script converts the contents of a PDF file into an audiobook format, allowing users to listen to the text instead of reading it visually. The script utilizes text-to-speech functionality to vocalize the content of the PDF file, providing an accessible alternative for consuming textual content.

## Features

- Converts PDF documents into spoken words, making them accessible to individuals with visual impairments or reading difficulties.
- Supports reading of PDF files containing text content in various languages.
- Provides a hands-free listening experience, allowing users to multitask while absorbing information from documents.
- Enables users to control the pace of the audiobook playback, pausing and resuming as needed.
- Simple to use, with the ability to specify the input PDF file and listen to the audiobook output in the terminal.

To use the Audiobook script, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install pyttsx3 PyPDF2`.
2. Place your PDF file in the same directory as the script or specify the file path in the script.
